ZFS on Fedora Server 31

This is for ease of use for my use for installing ZFS on Linux (ZoL) on Fedora Server 31. It will probably work with Fedora Server 30. It will most definitely not work for CentOS 8 based on my testing.

Use at your own risk. No warranty is inferred, implied, or guaranteed. In short: TEST TEST TEST on disposable machines, be they virtual or physical, before rolling this in to production.
